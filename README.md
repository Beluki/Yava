## About

Yava is a small emulator/game launcher for Windows. In short: it's a convenient
menu to run all your games from a single place. It's also portable, meaning you
can put Yava and all your emulators/roms in a usb key and carry them anywhere.

Features:

* Simple, fast, lightweight, robust.

* Easy to configure through an ini file. The file can be reloaded from the GUI.

* It doesn't try manage your roms or impose any particular organization.
  In fact, it doesn't even keep an internal database, just uses folders and files.

* It can launch anything, with any command-line parameters. Emulators tested
  include Bizhawk, DesMuMe, Dolphin, Fceux, Kega, Mame, DosBox...

* Provides hotkeys to close the launched emulators, both properly and forcefully.

* Remembers the last selected file for each folder.

* You can "search as you type" like in Windows Explorer. Multiple folders can be
  selected, so it's possible to search the entire rom collection.
